## OpeningText1
Once upon a time,[N]
there was a mystical item[N]
known as the "Fire Emblem".[A][N]
Using its power, the legendary King Sahad[N]
was able to found a great kingdom.[A][N]
Shortly before his death, King Sahad[N]
released the Fire Emblem back into[N]
the world. He decreed to his people:[A][N]
"Upon my death, he who wields the[N]
Fire Emblem shall sit upon my throne.[A][N]
I have released it into the Sea;[N]
you simply have to find it."[A][N]
Ever since, treasure hunters from all over[N]
the world set sail for the Gaete Sea,[A][N]
searching for the Fire Emblem,[N]
the treasure that would make[N]
their dreams come true![A][X]
